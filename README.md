# NLP_work
This Jupyter Notebook builds a PEGASUS-based text summarization pipeline using Hugging Faceâ€™s transformer models. The entire workflow follows these steps:

Install dependencies and import libraries.
Load dataset (prompts.csv) from Google Drive.
Preprocess text using NLTK (tokenization & stopword removal).
Load PEGASUS model & tokenizer for summarization.
Define summarization function to generate summaries.
Apply summarization to each text entry in the dataset.
Save summarized results to a CSV file.
Display sample summaries for verification.
This notebook is well-structured for automated text summarization and can be extended for fine-tuning PEGASUS on a custom dataset.
